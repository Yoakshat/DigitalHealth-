# Description

There's a TLDR and a list of sources to help people learn more about digital health and inspire young health-tech entrepreneurs. 

# TLDR: The Main Piece 
Our healthcare system is broken and it's not that hard to see with various articles and videos pointing the same headline out. The headline that visiting
the doctor once a year is not enough. But let's not blame anyone -- in fact from the system everyone is being affected from patients to doctors. Doctors cannot
build close relationships with their patients, stuck, having to write every word a patient says on the computer. This is a common example everyone gives of digital
health, on how this can be automated by voice -- a device like Alexa recording & transcribing the keywords. Yet we still see this system nowhere. 

For this sake, the common mantra goes -- "AI can help make healthcare more human." Automation is one piece of digital health. In fact, the two things everyone 
is keeping in their mind right now is *how can we create a health-AI company* and *how do we make it ethical*. It's less the end of the world robots-type ethical, 
but the risk so many patients are put at by handing care to AI. Thus, in healthcare our tools are currently physician-AI interactions, where physicians check over 
the result: and maybe it reduces their time 5-fold. 

The other part is the mantra -- "Patient-centric care." This can mean a couple of things. One part is being completely transparent with patients and simplifying 
the health language that doctors always throw at us. One example of a digital health solution is having your phone listen to what the doctor is saying, and take
all the keywords and transform it into an action plan that patients follow. I often forget everything the doctor says as quick as a snap, and as soon as I leave the place, 
I have no way to communicate with my doctor easily. Examples of digital health solutions for communication are: telehealth (think social media and Zoom for health). Now
you can contact your doctors anytime, anywhere. The second part is making patient experience simple. Sometimes we're thrown into the orthodontist
s office or the cardiologist's office: so many different areas of health. All these areas are fragmented: we're one person, we have one health. The areas, 
the stories of our health need to be connected. We and the doctors need to understand how they're connected. We have 30 doctors all telling us different things 
based on different data -- yet we don't have one global action plan. We are just left confused. Then what's the point of healthcare? Digital health is working on a space for everyone to connect together -- like the Internet. 

When I think of digital health, I define it as tech that enables doctors to have the best information to act on and patients to receive the best 
quality care.
